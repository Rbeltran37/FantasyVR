TOTAL BAKER v1.10 BASIC INSTRUCTIONS

Using Total Baker is easier than you may think! Once you have learned what the different parameters do, you can setup your bakes in less than a minute. A good way to become productive with Total Baker is to see it in action with sample models and configurations, eventually modifying them later.

You can download the Total Baker Samples package which contains 10 models (high+low poly) each with a ready-to-use configuration file. Once you import this package into your project, you will be able to open the configurations and immediately start a bake to see the results. 

The samples package is available here: https://mega.nz/#!BVYQxYqZ!PBCvyB_41VfSVizvKF-DAveqQWpyRSL4kM6hn8d1Zhg

Here's a very tiny step-by-step tutorial to do your first bake:

    1. Open Total Baker by clicking on Tools → Total Baker → Open Total Baker
    2. Click on the Load button and navigate to the Assets/Total Baker Samples folder
    3. Choose one of the samples folders, enter into it and open the configuration file you will find inside it
    4. Total Baker will load the settings and spawn the input objects. You can visualize them in the scene
    5. Press the Bake buttonLook how the lowpoly model looks after the generated textures have been applied to it
    6. Save the results using the Save Textures button
    7. Done!
